In this project, we are asked to develop an on-line restraurant order and delivery system.


In order to access this project, we need to download xampp for our database and visual studio code for our source code.
<br>

XAMPP steps:<br>1.Once XAMPP has been downloaded, we need to create a database named logininfo. (type localhost/phpmyadmin in the browser)
<br>2.Then we will need to create tables using the SQLstatement.txt file that I created.
<br>3.Then we create a folder named SESERVER inside the folder htdocs. This folder will include all the source code. The path for this htdocs folder will be xampp/htdocs



Visual Studio Code steps:
<br>
1.Place the SESERVER folder inside the working enviroment, if you are new user of XAMPP pleases delete the "dashboard"
folder inside the htdocs folder
<br>
2.Clone all the source code and put them inside this folder.


<br>
If all the steps are done correctly, we type localhost in our brower and we will see the website.
