In this project, we are asked to develop an on-line restraurant order and delivery system.


In order to access this project, we need to download xampp for our database and visual studio code for our source code.
<br>
In order to use the chef,admin and delivery man features, please use the accounts and password that I created inside the txt named <b>"322 Givenaccount.txt"</b>.
<br>


XAMPP steps:<br>1.Once XAMPP has been downloaded, open it and we need to start two servers <b>Apache</b> and <b>MySQL</b>, once the servers have been started, we need to type http://localhost/phpmyadmin/ inside our browser. Then we need to create a database named <b>logininfo</b> by clicking the <b>New</b> button on the upper left hand side.
<br>2.Then we click in the database that we just created (logininfo) and we will need to create tables and insert some important datas inside the database by using the <b>SQLstatement.txt</b> file that I created,(simply copy paste) by clicking <b>SQL</b> button that is in the center of the screen.
<br>3.Then we create a folder named <b>SESERVER</b> inside the folder <b>htdocs</b>. This folder will be inside the path of where we install our xampp. In my case, the path for this htdocs folder is xampp/htdocs.  There might be some folders inside the <b>htdocs</b> folder, just delete everything inside. All we need is a folder called <b>SESERVER</b>.
<br>4. Clone the source codes inside the <b>sourceCode</b> folder on our git and put all the source code files inside the <b>SESERVER</b> folder.
<br>5. Type <b>http://localhost/</b> on the browser, and click on <b>SESERVER</b> that we see inside the index page. Note that if you didn't delete all the files or folders that are previously there, it is very hard to find the folder that you just created, so we recommend you to delete all the files or folders inside the <b>htdocs</b> folder before creating the <b>SESERVER</b> folder.
<br>6. If everything is done correctly, you will able to see our system.



Visual Studio Code steps: (if you want to see the source code)
<br>
1.Place the SESERVER folder inside the working enviroment of Visual Studio Code by simply dragging the folder to Visual Studio Code .
<br>
2.Clone all the source code and put them inside this folder if you have not done so.
<br>
3.Then you can see our code inside Visual Studio Code
