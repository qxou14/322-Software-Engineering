In this project, we are asked to develop an on-line restraurant order and delivery system.


In order to access this project, we need to download xampp for our database and visual studio code for our source code.
<br>
In order to use the chef,admin and delivery man features, please use the accounts and password that I created inside the txt named "322 Givenaccount".
<br>
Also, remember to insert the data inside the appointment relation by using the insert statements I provided in the SQLstatement.txt

XAMPP steps:<br>1.Once XAMPP has been downloaded, open it and we need to start two servers <b>Apache</b> and <b>MySQL</b>, once the servers have been started, we need to type http://localhost/phpmyadmin/ inside our browser. Then we need to create a database named <b>logininfo</b> by clicking the <b>new</b> button on the left hand side.
<br>2.Then we click in the database that we just created (logininfo) and we will need to create tables and insert some important datas using the SQLstatement.txt file that I created.(simply copy paste)
<br>3.Then we create a folder named <b>SESERVER</b> inside the folder htdocs. The path for this htdocs folder will be xampp/htdocs
<br>4. Clone the source codes inside the <b>sourceCode</b> folder on our git and put all the source code files inside the <b>SESERVER</b> folder.
<br>5. Type <b>http://localhost/</b> on the browser, and click on <b>SESERVER</b> that we see inside the index page.
<br>6. If everything is done correctly, you will able to see our system.



Visual Studio Code steps: (if you want to see the source code)
<br>
1.Place the SESERVER folder inside the working enviroment of Visual Studio Code by simply dragging the folder to Visual Studio Code .
<br>
2.Clone all the source code and put them inside this folder.
<br>
3.Then you can see our code inside Visual Studio Code
