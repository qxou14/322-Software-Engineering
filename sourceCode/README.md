In this project, we are asked to develop an on-line restraurant order and delivery system.


In order to access this project, we need to download xampp for our database and visual studio code for our source code.


XAMPP steps:
1. Once XAMPP has been downloaded, we need to create a database named logininfo.
2.Then we will need to create tables using the SQLstatement.txt file that I created.
3.Then we create a folder named SESERVER inside the folder htdocs. The path for this htdocs folder will be xampp/htdocs


Visual Studio Code steps:
1.Place the SESERVER folder inside the working enviroment.
2.Clone all the source code and put them inside this folder.
